  summary: 'Project workflow management for signac projects.'
  description: |
    The signac-flow tool provides the basic components to setup simple to
    complex workflows for signac projects. That includes the definition of
    data pipelines, execution of data space operations and the submission
    of operations to high-performance super computers.
    The implementation is in pure Python, requires signac and is tested for
    Python versions 2.7 and 3.5+.
